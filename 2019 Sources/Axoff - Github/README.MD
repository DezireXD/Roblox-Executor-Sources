# Why

I did this because I'm bored and I wanted to update axon. I'll try to keep this updated but no promises.

# Credits

1) Rakion99 - Leaking Axon
2) Aero - Creating Axon
3) Customality - Making Hexus/Base for Axon

Notes:

This is not created by me. All I'm doing is expanding upon the code. Use at your own risk.
